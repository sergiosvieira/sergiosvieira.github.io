## My Personal Web Page

I always enjoyed the idea of making a computer do what I want. My first programming experience
was when I was twelve years old with my old computer TK3000II/e. Since that, I never stopped
programming, and nowadays, I still have fun learning new programming languages and improving
my programming skills.
